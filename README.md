Grocery-List-Maker
==================

Grocery-List-Maker for Use by Anyone who Purchases Groceries in Stores

Why?
-----------
Having recently become a vegetarian, I want to use some new recipes.  The frustrating thing is that when I want to make something from a recipe, I am inevitably missing some random ingredient like condensed milk.  This program allows you to choose a few recipes to use for the next week and then shop for the items you would need to purchase.
